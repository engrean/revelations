Revelations is my work around some text-mining stuff I am working on.

To start with, I am working on an NER system that can train/tag tweets, comments, and
articles. The idea is to start with a training set from Wikipedia, followed by twitter.

I am working with a file I got from a co-worker who wrote a perl library to auto-classify
articles and then pick out the sentences that contain those words, tagging them 
appropriately. I will either get his permission to to add his work to this project or
rewrite it myself as this part also fascinates me.
